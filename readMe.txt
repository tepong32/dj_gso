-------------------------------
This project aims to eliminate the hassle (and excuses) of broken-down, relic PCs.
Additionally, working with GSheets provides utilities for data extracting (same as excel) but with additional features like:
	- working collaborately, real-time
	- being able to tell "who-made-what" changes
	- being able to "restore" certain versions of the record in cases someone intentionally deletes it (sabotage)

Initially, this is just for the General Services Office but, perhaps, creating slots/pages for other departments and eventually making this the official, centralized database/website for the LGU can be looked-into. We'll need more developpers for that, tho.
